# Geospatial Analysis Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts, and R scripts for geospatial analysis. The scripts cover various geospatial tasks and workflows, such as data processing, spatial analysis, remote sensing, and visualization.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating geospatial analysis workflows using Python. Each notebook focuses on a specific analysis or technique and provides explanations, code examples, and visualizations.

- [Notebook 1](./notebooks/notebook1.ipynb)
- [Notebook 2](./notebooks/notebook2.ipynb)

## Google Earth Engine (GEE) Scripts

The `gee-scripts` directory contains scripts written in JavaScript for the Google Earth Engine platform. These scripts showcase the use of GEE for geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and accessing satellite imagery.

- [Script 1](./gee-scripts/script1.js)
- [Script 2](./gee-scripts/script2.js)

## R Scripts

The `r-scripts` directory includes R scripts for geospatial analysis and spatial data processing. These scripts demonstrate various spatial operations, data manipulation, and visualization techniques using R packages.

- [Script 1](./r-scripts/script1.R)
- [Script 2](./r-scripts/script2.R)

## Data

The `data` directory contains example datasets used in the scripts. These datasets are in various formats such as CSV, Shapefile, or other common geospatial data formats.

- [Dataset 1](./data/dataset1.csv)
- [Dataset 2](./data/dataset2.shp)

Feel free to explore the scripts and datasets provided in this repository. Contributions, bug fixes, and improvements are welcome!
